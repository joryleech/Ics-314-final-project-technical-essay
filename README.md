# Project: Tabletop Manoa.
## Overview
The problem: The tabletop industry has boomed over the last few years, but the nature of the games often requires people coming togehter to play them. This compounds with issues of college students who might not have great access to transport, or might feel more comfortable with other students. 

The solution: 
Tabletop Manoa has two user roles, which should be accessable to any user. The first role is that of a player. This person is someone who is looking to join a game that someone else has already decided to run. The other role is that of the Game Master, this is the person in charge of their game, who is looking for players with full admin controls to his own game page.

One of the most important parts about finding a game is making sure that it works with every players schedule. To ensure it is easier to find games that work with a persons schedule, the application should support browsing through available games by what times they are being played. 

Finally many games have more information than what can be contained in a single blurb. Because of this it is important that each game gets a personal customized page, that the game master can edit. 





## Mockup Page Ideas
Some possible mockup pages include:
* Public Landing Page
* Login Page
* User Homepage (Showing both games in and games lead).
* Procedural Game Pages (with admin page abilities).
* Browse games based on system and times


## Beyond the Basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

* Information Push, for when a games information gets changed
* Application Process, for game master who would like to vet their players a bit.
* Basic Communication, a comment section for players in a game to chat.
